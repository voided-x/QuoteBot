# Yokitsu
The ultimate bot for your anime and utilitarian needs

## Note to self-hosters
This bot is, and always will be, free, both on the public instance and internally (source code), however, we'd like to state a few things before you dive in and start self-hosting your own instance

- Your instance must be private
- We will not offer support for self-hosters, the server is for help with the public instance and other Voided X bots

Configuration example provided below

## Config
Create a file called `.env` in the root of your directory and create the following entries to fill out before you run the bot
```
TOKEN=
PREFIX=
# If you wanna specify mutiple, do "<id1>,<id2>"
OWNERS=
```
