# Yokitsu

The ultimate bot for your anime and utilitarian needs

## Note to self-hosters

This bot is, and always will be, free, both on the public instance and internally (source code), however, we'd like to state a few things before you dive in and start self-hosting your own instance

- Your instance must be private
- Help will not be given or offered. You are expected to know how to set it up when you start to self-host.

Configuration example provided below

## Config

Create a file called `config.json` in the the src (source) directory and create the following entries to fill out before you run the bot

```json
{
    "token": "",
    "prefix": "?",
    "owners": []
}
```
