# Yokitsu

The ultimate bot for your anime and utilitarian needs

## Note to self-hosters

This bot is, and always will be, free, both on the public instance and internally (source code), however, we'd like to state a few things before you dive in and start self-hosting your own instance

- Your instance must be private
- Help will not be given or offered. You are expected to know how to set it up when you start to self-host.

Configuration example provided below

## Config

Create a file called `.env` in the root directory and create the following entries to fill out before you run the bot:

```
# Default Prefix for Yokitsu
YOKITSU_PREFIX=?

# Discord application token for connecting to Discord
YOKITSU_TOKEN=

# Owners of the bot, split using a comma (i.e: "{owner1},{owner2}")
OWNERS=
```
